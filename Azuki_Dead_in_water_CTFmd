## Scenario

 The report for **_Dead in the Water – Azuki Import/Export_** reflects an intentional reduction in depth and presentation compared to previous threat hunt reports. This scoping decision was made to prioritize timely identification of actionable findings, preserve investigative momentum, and support transition to subsequent investigative phases.  
 
This report emphasizes key indicators, pivotal observations, and response-relevant conclusions rather than extended narrative development, exhaustive correlation, or full artifact documentation. The core analytical rigor remains intact, and the findings captured here directly informed containment considerations and follow-on investigative planning.

## Conclusion
This incident demonstrates a **methodical, multi‑stage ransomware operation** with deliberate focus on:
- Backup and recovery destruction **before** encryption
- Lateral deployment via admin tooling
- Persistent access and anti‑forensic cleanup

Result

The attacker achieved full operational impact with minimal resistance, underscoring gaps in backup isolation, credential hygiene, and endpoint monitoring.
